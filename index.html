<h1>Amazing Net Art</h1>
<h2>by Heidi</h2>
<p>
  Art used to be a luxury for many people. It costs money to make art, and it costs money to buy art. The poor did not have the chance to experience art; until recently. Now, with the development of the internet and phones, it is rare for people to not have experienced art. Although you could say that still, not everybody is able to experience art, art does not have to be restricted to fine arts. The singers singing songs near the park, Grafitti scribbled on the brick walls, even the designs on your shirts. Those are all art. Art is everywhere now, and it has become much easier to buy and sell art.

  That is why I have created this online store with a free website-making tool selling free art taken from the Art Institue of Chicago's website, where it is free to view artworks online. I have put the most well-known artworks so that people could easily recognize them. Anyone can buy their free copies of artwork, however many you would like to buy here (although you cannot actually purchase them).
